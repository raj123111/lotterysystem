# lotterysystem
To run this project in VS Code, you'll need the following files:

# Essential Files:
main.py - This is the main application file containing the Flask web server and all the lottery logic
templates/index.html - The HTML template for the web interface
Database-related Files:
instance/lottery.db - This SQLite database file will be created automatically when the application runs
# Required Python Libraries:
You'll need to install these packages using pip:
flask
flask-sqlalchemy
# How to Run in VS Code:
Create a folder for your project
Copy main.py and create a templates folder with index.html inside it
Open a terminal in VS Code and install the required packages:
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy
Run the application with:
python main.py
Access the application at http://localhost:5000
The application should work perfectly in VS Code with just these files. You don't need any of the .pythonlibs or other Replit-specific files, as those are just dependency installations specific to the Replit environment.
